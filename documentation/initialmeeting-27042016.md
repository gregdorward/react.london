# react.london website
< mission statement here >

## MVP
By next Friday (06/05/2016) we will have a page that displays key information about what react.london is and the next meetup. It will have some calls to action to sign up to the event, join the public slack channel, to be a sponsor and to be a speaker. Amy will be able to update, preview and publish this page.

## Initial meeting notes and understanding

We identified three main themes the ideas addressed:

**Social** - maintain/grow community

**Information** - plain simple read only information

**Managerial / ticketing** - ability for Amy to manage the information and community, and to replace meetup.com fully.

## Social

#### Event board
* commenting on individual events (see meetup.com)

#### General board
* notice board for community use (like general meetup.com board, elm meetup setup)
  * possible posts:
    * ideas
    * job hunting
    * recruiting
    * collaboration on projects
  * keep it general! Introduce organisation once the users use it how they want.

#### Slack channel promotion

#### Activity on #LondonReact
  * embed twitter/instagram/whatever


## Information (read only)

#### Upcoming event(s)
  * when
  * where
  * who
  * what about
  * get tickets cta

#### Past events
  * summary (when, where, who, what about)
  * relevant media: (may be submitted by non Badgers)
    * slide decks
    * videos
    * gallery
  * tweets / social media presence

#### Be a speaker cta
  * talk idea
  * who to contact

#### Be a sponsor cta
  * different ways of sponsoring:
    * provide drinks/food
    * provide venue
    * provide cold hard cash
    * pay for a shoutout

## Managerial / ticketing

#### Sign up for a ticket
  * our own ticketing system
  * takes into account different venue requirements (facebook, skills matter want different information)
  * Keep it simple, stupid: 1 user, 1 ticket, 1 email, no charge

#### Sign up to be notified of future events

#### Normalised store of contact information
  * currently contact details are on multiple platforms
  * involve people who have previously been to an event

####Â Amy can message relevant people
  * sends out big group emails
    * information about event
    * asking for feedback post-event
    * promoting events
